# Book Recommendation System (BPR Model)

A production-style collaborative filtering recommendation system built using 
**Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)** and PyTorch.

This project implements an implicit-feedback recommender system trained on user-book interaction data and evaluated using ranking-based metrics.

---

## Project Overview

This system:

- Filters sparse users and items
- Splits data per user (leave-one-out strategy)
- Encodes raw IDs into embedding indices
- Trains a BPR model using negative sampling
- Evaluates with ranking metrics
- Provides interactive CLI-style recommendations
- Analyzes dataset sparsity and popularity bias

---

## Model Architecture

The model learns:

- User embeddings
- Book embeddings

Prediction score is computed as:

score(u, i) = dot(user_embedding, item_embedding)

Loss Function:
Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR Loss)

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using:

- **HitRate@5**
- **HitRate@10**
- **NDCG@10**

Example performance:

```
HitRate@5  : 0.4924
HitRate@10 : 0.6698
NDCG@10    : 0.3964
```


These metrics measure ranking quality rather than rating prediction.

## Dataset Analysis

- Users: 35,710  
- Books: 10,000  
- Ratings: 932,940  
- Sparsity: 99.74%

The dataset is highly sparse, which is typical for recommender systems.

---

## Popularity Bias Analysis

The project includes:

- Top 10 most popular books
- Top 10 least popular books
- Average ratings per book
- Median ratings per book

This helps analyze popularity skew in recommendations.
